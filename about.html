                		<p>This concept came about as a visualization for a recent road trip my wife and I took in Colorado. After the trip, my wife spread a giant map across the kitchen table to show her parents all the places we visited and trace our route. It gave me the idea to do something similar as a web visualization; a cross between a map and scrapbook. This tool can share our trip with friends and family and help us to relive the trip, the stops cuing all of the great memories.</p>
                        <p>The list of locations is seeded with an external custom GEOJSON file, so additional files can be loaded in for future trips. I did a sample Chicago and Camping Trip, as examples. Developing this further, I would like to add more information about each of the stops and of course more pictures. I'm still figuring out the Mapbox API (I first started with Google Maps API and found Mapbox more capable for what I was hoping to achieve), so the functionality will evolve along with my knowledge of the API. I wanted to get the basic layout and interaction fleshed out first. Actually tracing the driving route between the points is a big feature for the future.</p>                        
                        <p>To further explore the concept, I will also demonstrate a workflow to add locations to a trip. There is also a lot of opportunity to bring in illustration and personalization to the design. Currently, there  are three variants of the header: mountains, city, and camping.</p>
                        <p>I used the following tools to build this concept: it's a client-side JavaScript application (no framework or databased) using the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/">Mapbox JS API</a> the sidebar leans heavily on <a href="http://iscrolljs.com">iScroll</a>, icons and banner imagery is based on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/07/freebie-smashicons-icon-set/">Smashicons</a>, and photos are either originals or borrowed from google image search (if this ever goes commercial, it will be populated with user submitted photos). All HTML, JavaScript, and CSS is mine.</p>
